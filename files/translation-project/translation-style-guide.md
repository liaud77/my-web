### Context
This Style Guide, developed alongside the translator's manual, is designed to standardize and refine the translation process for literary works. It aims to serve translators, editors, reviewers, and the project manager by establishing clear stylistic and linguistic standards, ensuring the translated work resonates with the target audience while staying true to the original's spirit.

### Problem
Literary translation is an intricate art that requires not only linguistic accuracy but also cultural sensitivity and stylistic precision. The absence of detailed stylistic guidelines can lead to inconsistencies in tone, style, and voice across different sections of the translated work, potentially compromising the original's literary qualities and diminishing the reader's experience.

### Contribution
To enhance the quality and coherence of literary translations, I contributed to the Style Guide by:
- Integrating insights from literary translation theory and practice to formulate clear, applicable stylistic rules.
- Collaborating with linguists, literary scholars, and the project team to ensure the guidelines accommodate both linguistic fidelity and literary style.
- Establishing guidelines that balance the need for accuracy with the creative liberties necessary to capture the original's tone and intent.

### Impact 
By providing translators with a set of standardized stylistic parameters, this Style Guide enhances the readability and appeal of the translated work, fostering a deeper appreciation of the original literary masterpiece among a new audience. Ultimately, the guide aids in maintaining the integrity of the translation, facilitating a successful cultural and linguistic transfer.

## 1. Annotation
Provide annotations for content related to history, geography, culture, religion, customs, or lifestyle unfamiliar to the target readers.

Place annotations at each chapter's end with sequential numbering that resets every new chapter. Ensure annotations are concise for easier proofreading and typesetting. Follow the specified format closely:
- Within the translated text, add English square brackets and numbers at the end of the word or sentence requiring annotation. 
- At the end of the chapter, add English square brackets [ ], followed by the number and the annotation.

Example:

In-text:

During a break at the TED conference in February 2007, I had a conversation with Chris Anderson[2], the current editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, about his new book *Free*.

End of chapter:

[2] Chris Anderson: Since 2001, he has served as the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine in the United States and has published works such as *The Long Tail* and *Free: The Future of a Radical Price*.

## 2. Formatting
Preserve in the translated text the corresponding formats that the author intentionally used in the original text, as they carry specific meanings and functions. 
### Font
Use matching fonts in the translation for font changes and combinations in the original text, with the following exceptions when translating into Chinese:

**Exception 1: Italics in Source Text**
- For titles of publications, use angle brackets (ã€Šã€‹) with the title in regular text format.
- For song titles, enclose them in quotation marks ("") with the title in regular text. 

**Exception 2: Capitals in Source Text**
- Convert all words in all caps from the source text to boldface, maintaining standard text formatting.
- Retain normal text formatting for specific capitalized terms, such as names of institutions or organizations.

### Font Size, Line Spacing, and Starting a New Page
Retain the original changes in font size, line spacing, and page breaks in chapter titles and main text whenever possible.
### Spaces
Keep the following original text formats:
- left or right indentations in paragraphs;
- intentional irregular arrangements in poetry (distinguished from line breaks);
- intentional spaces or line breaks in the main text.

## 3. Punctuation Before and After Quotations

### Conform to English Conventions
- The dialogue ends after the quotation: "â€¦â€¦," he said.
- The dialogue does not end after the quotation,
  - The first quotation is not complete: "â€¦â€¦," he said, "â€¦â€¦."
  - The first quotation is complete: "â€¦â€¦," he said. "â€¦â€¦."

### Conform to Chinese Conventions
- The dialogue ends after the quotation: "â€¦â€¦." he said.
- The dialogue does not end after the quotation,
  - The first quotation is not complete: "â€¦â€¦," he said, "â€¦â€¦."
  - The first quotation is complete: "â€¦â€¦." he said, "â€¦â€¦."

**Note:** The choice between English or Chinese punctuation conventions is at the translator's discretion due to industry debates. Ensure consistency throughout a project.

## 4. Personal and Place Names
Follow the guidelines provided by the reference books below. Use transliteration guidelines for names not found, including those invented by the author.

**Note:** Use established translations for well-known figures and locations such as *Shakespeare* and *Times Square*.

- **English Names Translation Handbook** (China Commercial Press, 2018) for the translation of English personal names 
- **World Names Translation Dictionary** (China Translation Corporation, 1993) for the translation of personal names in other languages
- **American Place Names Dictionary** (China Commercial Press, 2000) for the translation of place names in America
- **Dictionary of World Place Names** (Encyclopedia of China Publishing House, 1984) for the translation of place names in other countries 

## 5. Numbers
### Time Representation
- Always use Arabic numerals for time-related numbers (centuries, years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds).

### General Numbers
- For numbers up to and including 10, use Arabic numerals.
- For numbers greater than 10, use Chinese characters, except when mixing numbers smaller and larger than 10 in the same context; in such cases, use Arabic numerals for all.

### Number Ranges
- Describe ranges with Chinese characters.
- For ranges exceeding 100 with specific reference numbers, use Arabic numerals.

### Large Numbers
- For numbers exceeding 10,000, substitute "ä¸‡" for 10,000 and "äº¿" for 100,000,000 in Chinese characters.
- Insert a space every three digits for clarity, e.g., "4 500" seconds, "54 000" units.

## 6. References
- Follow the guidelines provided by *English-Chinese Dictionary (Shanghai Translation Publishing House, 2005)* for English-Chinese text. 
- Follow the standardization outlined in *Contemporary Chinese Dictionary (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 2005)* to avoid errors in Chinese translation.
