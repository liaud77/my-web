Iâ€™m a Content Marketing Strategist specializing in SEO-driven B2B and B2C content, with expertise in Tech, SaaS, and E-Commerce. I create tailored strategies to boost your brand's visibility, showcase your expertise and authoritativeness. 

- For B2B, I focus on creating value-driven assets like learning resources, industry insights, case studies, and thought leadership content to educate decision-makers and drive lead generation. 
- For B2C, I prioritize engaging, emotionally resonant contentâ€”think social campaigns, product storytelling, and user-generated contentâ€”to build brand loyalty and drive conversions.

I handle every aspect of the content creation process, from keyword research, content planning and briefing, to writing and optimization.
