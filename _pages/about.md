Iâ€™m a technical writer with expertise in SEO, computational linguistics, and prompt engineering. As a former translator, I write in both English and Chinese.

These skills give me a strong toolkit: 
- I can build and manage structured knowledge bases, 
- design scalable and reusable content workflows, 
- and optimize documentation for discoverability and long-term maintenance. 

My background in customer success and translation also helps me work efficiently with subject-matter experts (SMEs), gathering the right information and delivering clear outputs for all stakeholders.

Iâ€™ve worked with clients across industries including B2B SaaS, healthtech, e-commerce, fintech, energy, and manufacturing. In each case, I translate expert knowledge into documentation and content that is accurate, accessible, and aligned with business goals.

On this website, youâ€™ll find my writing samples and experiences.
