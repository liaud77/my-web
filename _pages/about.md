I'm a passionate graduate student in Linguistic Data Sciences at the University of Eastern Finland, eagerly setting out on my professional journey in the world of technical writing. With a foundation built on four years of working, I've honed my skills in writing and translation, navigating the intricate dance of words to communicate complex ideas with clarity and precision.

This website is a showcase of my experiences and skills. Feel free to explore my projects and writing samples to get a sense of my expertise and style. You can also see a one-page PDF CV with selected experiences [here](/my-web/files/cv-audrey.pdf). 

Thank you for stopping by!
